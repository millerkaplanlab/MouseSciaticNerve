### Abstract
Peripheral innervation plays an important role in regulating tissue repair and
regeneration. Here, we provide evidence that injured peripheral nerves provide a
reservoir of mesenchymal precursor cells that can directly contribute to murine digit tip
regeneration and skin repair. In particular, using single-cell RNA sequencing and
lineage tracing we identify transcriptionally-distinct mesenchymal cell populations
within the control and injured adult nerve, including neural crest-derived cells in the
endoneurium with characteristics of mesenchymal precursor cells. Culture and
transplantation studies show that these nerve-derived mesenchymal cells have the
potential to differentiate into non-nerve lineages. Moreover, following digit tip
amputation, the neural crest-derived nerve mesenchymal cells contribute to the
regenerative blastema and ultimately to the regenerated bone. Similarly, neural crest-
derived nerve mesenchymal cells contribute to the dermis during skin wound healing.
These findings support a model where peripheral nerves directly contribute
mesenchymal precursor cells to promote repair and regeneration of injured mammalian
tissues.

These are  cells from the mouse sciatic nerve 9 days post-injury isolated using FACS.
